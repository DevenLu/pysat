**Q. Yeah, but what about ...?**

A. If a dataset is not in the current list of instruments or in the list on the develop branch, feel free to add it as a pull request.  For the most part, pysat makes it simple to add instruments.  Templates are included for the NASA CDAWeb and Madrigal databases.  Check out info about adding an instrument here: https://pysat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/new_instrument.html# and make sure to read the guidelines for pull requests here: https://github.com/rstoneback/pysat/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
